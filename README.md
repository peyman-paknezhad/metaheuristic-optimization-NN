# Metaheuristic Optimization Neural Networks (MONNs)

Welcome to the Metaheuristic Optimization Neural Networks (MONNs) repository! This repository focuses on the application of Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithm to optimize the performance of neural networks on the IRIS classification problem.

## Simulated Annealing

Simulated Annealing is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It is particularly useful for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Simulated Annealing starts with an initial solution and iteratively explores the solution space by allowing "worse" solutions to be accepted with a certain probability. As the algorithm progresses, the acceptance probability decreases, leading to a convergence towards an optimal solution. In the context of MONNs, Simulated Annealing can be used to optimize the weights and biases of the neural network.

## Genetic Algorithm

Genetic Algorithm is another metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics. It is well-suited for solving optimization problems with a large search space and multiple local optima. Genetic Algorithm operates by maintaining a population of candidate solutions and iteratively applying selection, crossover, and mutation operations to generate new candidate solutions. The fittest individuals in each generation are more likely to be selected for reproduction, leading to the evolution of the population towards better solutions. In the context of MONNs, Genetic Algorithm can be used to optimize the architecture or hyperparameters of the neural network.
